This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects that were developed as part of a deep learning course. The projects were a collaborative effort with my group members, where we explored various neural network architectures and techniques. 
Each project is stored in its respective directory, which includes the code and necessary documentation.

Projects
1. Classification with CNNs
In this project, we implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform image classification. The focus was on understanding how CNN layers, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, contribute to the model's ability to recognize patterns in images.

2. Implementing an ANN with Keras
This project involved building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Keras library. We explored different activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers to train the model on a dataset and evaluated its performance using various metrics.

3. Semantic Segmentation with U-net
We utilized the U-net architecture to perform semantic segmentation on images. This project was crucial in understanding how U-net, with its encoder-decoder structure, can be applied to label each pixel of an image with a class.

4. Variational Encoder
In this project, we delved into unsupervised learning by implementing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VAE was used to learn the latent representation of the input data, allowing for the generation of new, similar data points.
